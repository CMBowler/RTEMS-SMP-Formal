\section{Introduction}

This document provides simulations of the various thread queue designs used
in the RTEMS operating system. 
These range from simple first-in first-out (FIFO) designs,
through priority-based approaches, 
to algorithms for SMP that support schedulability analysis.

We focus on thread queues for RTEMS Tasks waiting to gain access
to a shared resource, via a mutex lock.

The basic building blocks are a simple FIFO queue, 
and a priority queue that assumes all threads have a unique priority.

The most complex form is a round-robin/FIFO queue 
whose contents are priority queues, 
one for each scheduling cluster.
This is used to implement the 
Multiprocessor Resource Sharing Protocol(MrsP) 
thread queue algorithm.
